Original dataset link: http://www.diid.unipa.it/cvip/

In the CM+CFM Dataset:
1. The folder "Original" contains selected image samples from the CVIP dataset.
2. The folder "CM Only" contains images undergone CM forgery only.
3. The folder "CFM Only" contains images undergone CFM forgery (aka flip, reflection, or mirroring).
4. The folder "CM+CFM" contains images undergone both CM and CFM forgeries, with slight rotation and scaling.
5. The folder "CFM+Post_JPEG" contains images undergone CFM forgery followed by JPEG compression of whole image.
6. The folder "CFM+Post_WGN" contains images undergone CFM forgery with WGN added to copied portion.
7. The folder "CFM+Post_Scale" contains images undergone CFM forgery with copied potion scaled.
